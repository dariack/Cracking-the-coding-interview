## [List Cycle](https://github.com/dariack/Cracking-the-coding-interview/blob/master/ListCycle.py)

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
Try solving it using constant additional space.

Example :

Input : 

                  ______
                 |     |
                 \/    |
        1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

Return the node corresponding to node 3. 

## [Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://github.com/dariack/Cracking-the-coding-interview/blob/master/RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedList.py)

Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

For example,
Given `1->1->2`, return `1->2`.
Given `1->1->2->3->3`, return `1->2->3`.

## [Remove Nth Node from List End](https://github.com/dariack/Cracking-the-coding-interview/blob/master/RemoveNthNodeFromListEnd.py)

Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,
Given linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`, and `n = 2`.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes `1->2->3->5`.

Note:
If `n` is greater than the size of the list, remove the first node of the list.
Try doing it using constant additional space.

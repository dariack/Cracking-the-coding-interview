## [List Cycle](https://github.com/dariack/Cracking-the-coding-interview/blob/master/ListCycle.py)

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
Try solving it using constant additional space.

Example :

Input : 

                  ______
                 |     |
                 \/    |
        1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

Return the node corresponding to node 3.
